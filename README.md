**A system for monitoring power consumption using an ESP32 and a Python server.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

PowerPulse-ESP32 is a system designed to monitor and log power consumption data.  It utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect readings and a Python server to process and store this information.  The system is suitable for projects requiring real-time power usage tracking and analysis. The ESP32 acts as a client, sending heartbeat signals to the server.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time power consumption monitoring via ESP32.
- Data logging and storage on a Python server.
- System status reporting.
- Simple, easy-to-deploy architecture.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**

- Python

**Embedded:**

- ESP32 Microcontroller


## 🚀 Quick Start

This project requires an ESP32 microcontroller and a system capable of running the Python server.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (version will depend on specific libraries used, check `requirements.txt`)
- ESP32 development environment (Arduino IDE recommended)
- `pyserial` Python library


### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/h4ndsh/PowerPulse-ESP32.git
   cd PowerPulse-ESP32
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.  This will likely contain settings for database connection, if any, and other relevant parameters.

4. **ESP32 Setup:**
   - Upload the appropriate code to your ESP32 (details within the `esp32` directory).  Configure the ESP32's serial port and baud rate according to your system.

5. **Run the Python server:**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

6. **Monitor:** Observe the server output for collected data.  The exact output format is determined by `server.py`.

├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── client.py          # Python client for interacting with the server (Example).
├── esp32/             # Directory for ESP32 firmware (Arduino sketches, etc.)
├── heartbeat.service  # Systemd service file (optional, for Linux).

└── server.py          # Main Python server script.
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

The `.env` file (created from `.env.example`) likely contains settings such as:

- `SERIAL_PORT`: Serial port connected to the ESP32.
- Database connection parameters (if a database is used).


## 🔧 Development

There are no explicit development scripts included.  Development will require interacting with both the ESP32 code and the Python server.  Changes to the Python server can be tested by restarting it.


## 🧪 Testing

No formal testing framework is present. Testing should involve verifying the communication between the ESP32 and the Python server and checking that data is being collected and logged correctly.  Manual testing is implied.


## 🚀 Deployment

Deployment instructions are not explicitly provided. Deployment will involve deploying the Python server to a suitable environment and configuring the ESP32 on the target system. This likely involves setting up the ESP32 on the target hardware, configuring its network settings and possibly setting up a systemd service using `heartbeat.service` if appropriate for the system.
