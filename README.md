**A real-time power monitoring system using an ESP32 and Python server, with Telegram alerts for power outages.**

</div>

## üìñ Overview

**PowerPulse-ESP32** is an intelligent system designed to monitor and log power consumption in real time. It uses an **ESP32 microcontroller** to collect readings and a **Python server** to process, store, and analyze the data.  

When a power outage or abnormal event is detected, the system sends **instant Telegram alerts** to configured chats, ensuring fast notifications and quick action.  

The ESP32 operates as a client, sending regular **heartbeat** signals to the server, enabling continuous and reliable monitoring.

## ‚ú® Features

- Real-time power consumption tracking via ESP32.
- Data logging and storage on a Python server.
- Instant Telegram alerts for power outages.
- Simple and easy-to-deploy architecture.
- Heartbeat-based monitoring to ensure continuous operation.
